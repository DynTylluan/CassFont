# CassFont
This is a copy of my very own font, based upon my own handwriting, free for anyone to use.

This is very much still a work in progress, I want to add other characters and convert these to SVG and a real font format, but I am happy for now. This also works as a showcase for what the final thing could look like.

## To Do

It would be nice to add common math symbols as well as the Roman alphabet and some common Unicode emojis/symbols.
